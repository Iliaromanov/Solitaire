# Solitaire

Recreating the Solitaire card game using the Python Arcade library. In this project, in order to avoid creating and managing each of the 52 cards in a card deck individually, I created a custom 'Playing_Card' class to create card objects and allow the addition of new functionalities/features with ease.

## Visuals/Demo
<img src="demo/gameplay1.gif" width="400" height="350" style="text-align: center" />

## Installation
Make sure to install the required Python arcade library by typing the following in your command line interface (CLI):

    pip install arcade


Now you may clone this repository using:

    git clone https://github.com/Iliaromanov/Solitaire.git

*Make sure to configure git beforehand.

### Running the program

When you run the program you will be prompted to input the path to the images directory that was cloned to your computer.

A quick and easy way to do this would be to just right-click the images directory and click 'Copy Path'. Then right click in your command line interface where the prompt for the input is and press enter.


You are now all set! Enjoy!
